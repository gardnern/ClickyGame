A memory game using React. The application is required to break up the UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

The application renders different image of dogs to the screen. Each image listen for click events.

The application track the user's score. The user's score increment when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page and shuffle themselves in a random order.

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restart.
